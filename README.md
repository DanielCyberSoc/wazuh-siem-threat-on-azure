## **1. Prerequisites**

To complete this project, youâ€™ll need:

- An **Azure subscription**.
- A **Linux Virtual Machine** running on Azure, which will host the Wazuh Manager.
- A **Windows Virtual Machine** running on Azure, which will host the Wazuh Agent.
- A **basic understanding of SIEM concepts** and Wazuh configurations.

---

## **2. Virtual Machines Setup**

### **2.1 Linux VM (Wazuh Manager)**

1. Create a Linux Virtual Machine in Azure (Ubuntu 20.04 or later is recommended).  
   - Assign a static public IP address for accessibility.  
   - Ensure SSH is enabled during setup.  
   - Recommended size: **Standard_B2s** for basic workloads.

---

### **2.2 Windows VM (Wazuh Agent)**

1. Create a Windows Virtual Machine in Azure (Windows Server 2019 or later is recommended).  
   - Configure RDP access and enable a static public IP address.  
   - Ensure the machine has at least 2 vCPUs and 4GB RAM for optimal performance.  

![Windows VM Creation Screen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6f3dfaa-e2fb-4177-9392-c5f4b1c16a6a)


2. Enable the following ports for communication between the VMs:
   - TCP port 1514 for syslog.
   - TCP port 1515 for the Wazuh agent connection.

---

3. Native SSH from your local machine
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pem <your admin name>@<your public IP address>
   ```
## **3. Wazuh Installation**

### **3.1 Installing cURL for Ubuntu Linux**

1. Update the Linux VM:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
   ```

2. Next, install cURL, execute:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install curl
   ```
---

### **3.2 Installing Wazuh**

1. Download and run the Wazuh installation assistant.
   ```bash
   curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.10/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a
   ```
   Once the assistant finishes the installation, the output shows the access credentials and a message that confirms that the installation was successful.
   ```bash
   INFO: --- Summary ---
   INFO: You can access the web interface https://<WAZUH_DASHBOARD_IP_ADDRESS>
    User: admin
    Password: <ADMIN_PASSWORD>
   INFO: Installation finished.
   ```
2. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status wazuh-manager
   ```

### **3.3 Native RDP To Your Windows VM**

1. Open Remote Desktop Connection (RDP) on your local machine.

2. Enter the public IP address of the Windows VM and use the credentials configured during VM creation.

3. Access the Wazuh Dashboard via the correct Private IP address
   - Go to Linux VM and copy the Private IP address
   - Open web browser in Windows VM > https://<PrivateIPaddress>

   -Login with your credential we got from Installing Wazuh
   
   ```bash
   INFO: --- Summary ---
   INFO: You can access the web interface https://<WAZUH_DASHBOARD_IP_ADDRESS>
    User: admin
    Password: <ADMIN_PASSWORD>
   INFO: Installation finished.
   ```


### **3.4 Installing Wazuh Agent**

1. Download the Wazuh Agent on the Windows VM from the [Wazuh downloads page](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/wazuh-agent/wazuh-agent-package-windows.html).

2. Configure the agent to communicate with the Wazuh Manager:
   - Input the server's IP address (e.g., 10.0.0.4) in the agent configuration > save the settings
   - Start the service. Once the agent is running, you can return to the dashboard to verify its status.

---
3. Verify Agent Connection:

Return to the Wazuh dashboard and navigate to Agents.
Check the agent's status to confirm it is actively reporting data

## **4. Deployment, Monitoring, and Alerting**

### **4.1 Log Collection and Configuration**

1. Configure the Wazuh Manager to collect logs from both the Linux and Windows VMs.
   - Example of adding a local file to `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`:
     ```xml
     <localfile>
        <log_format>syslog</log_format>
        <location>/var/log/auth.log</location>
     </localfile>
     ```

2. For Windows, ensure event logs are forwarded to the Wazuh Manager.

### **4.2 Monitoring Alerts**

1. **Navigate to Threat Intelligence:**
   - Log in to the Wazuh dashboard (`https://<your-server-ip>`).
   - On the dashboard, go to **Threat Hunting** > **Events**.

2. **Filter Events:**
   - Use the filters to narrow down events by:
     - **Agent Name:** Select your agent (e.g., `wazuh-agent-vm`).
     - **Rule Description:** Look for logon failures or brute-force-related alerts.

3. **Analyze Brute-Force Attempts:**
   - Identify failed login attempts categorized under rule.id:
     - **Queries- 60122**
   - Review the timestamp, source IPs, and frequency of the attempts.

4. **Visualize Data:**
   - View the timeline chart for an overview of brute-force activity.
   - Identify patterns or specific timeframes with a spike in activity.

5. **Document Observations:**
   - Example: The screenshot with 689 available fields below shows failed login attempts detected by Wazuh in 24hours.
